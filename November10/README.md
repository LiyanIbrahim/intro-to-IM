For this assignment, I plan on implementing 2 exact patterns but the rate at which they occur will depend on if they are being controlled digitally or by analog sensors. 
<ul>

<li>Digital pattern → have a set delay time but will depend on pressing the switch?</li>
<li>Analog pattern → depends on LDR </li>

In both cases, brightness of the LEDs will depend on the potentiometer. 

My plan is to implement the 2 LEDs, switch (maybe 2) and LDR first and make sure the program works like I want it to. After that, I will add the potentiometer and its functionalities to both the patterns. 
I also plan on breaking the code up into different functions which will hopefully be easier for debugging any errors.
