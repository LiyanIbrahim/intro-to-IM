## Concept: 
For this assignment, after changing my idea about 4 times, I decided to do something slightly experimental. While, as programmers, we can tell the difference between analog and digital from a technical point of view which extends towards a visual point of view. Therefore, for this assignment, the user can click between two buttons, one runs analog and the other runs digitally. Both would blink the 2 LEDs to the rhythm of the nursery rhyme Twinkle twinkle little star. The digital pattern has set delay times to match the song while the analog pattern has a delay time that depends on the light intensity but it scaled so it matches the song.</br> 
Note that it depends on one reading of the light intensity.

## Problems and Solutions: 
Coming up with an idea: Once I built the circuit and had the hardware components set, coming up with an idea to do with them was more challenging than I thought. I eventually ended up trying out different things and I picked the one I liked the most and had the most compelling and complete narrative.
PINS:I spent far too much time trying to debug the code because one of the LEDs was not lighting up in the analog pattern. Eventually, I figured out that it was the pin it was connected to does not have the ~ sign and therefore does not read analog.
