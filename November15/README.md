## My musical instrument: 

My take on a 3 key piano! 

I want to make my own version of a piano. This version will have 3 keys and the forth button would just play a song using these tones. It will also have three LEDâ€™s that will light up when a certain key is pressed. I will also be using the potentiometer to control the pitch of the sound
