## My musical instrument: 

My take on a 3 key piano! 

For this assignment, my musical instrument is composed of 4 buttons, one pot and one LED. The instrument has 4 modes. For all the modes, three of the buttons are used as piano buttons and so they play a note with pressed. When you change the mode, the pitch of the notes changes, making my instrument sort of like a “piano partitioner”. The fourth button however plays a certain song melody. This song changes with the mode. 

So in general, when you change the mode, the pitch of the three buttons changes and the song played when you press the fourth button also changes. 
The LED is used as a sort of indication of which level the person using the instrument is on. The higher the mode, the faster the LED blinks. The LED is on when the song plays (upon pressing the fourth button) for all the modes. Finally, the mode depends on the value in the pot.
