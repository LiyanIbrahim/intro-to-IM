## Adaptation of Memory Game using Arduino

For my Midterm project, I made a memory card game using processing. For this assignment, I wanted to adapt a similar concept to it but using LED’s in ardunio 

Initial Concept: 

For my initial concept, I wanted the LED’s to blink in a certain pattern then the user will try to recreate the pattern using the buttons. The processing would mainly be responsible for giving instructions that will be synchronized with the user input. I could not figure out a way in which the user can input after the LED’s light up. I’m still working on the code (which is also on this github repo) to figure this out.

Therefore, my adaptation of this assignment would utilize the fact that I’m using processing which reshow the user patterns which they have to pick the one that was just played by pressing on the corresponding button as shown in the video.
The game has 2 rounds, the second round will only start playing if the user guesses the first round correctly. Otherwise, if the user guesses wrong, the LED’s will light up all at once. 

I would like to note somethings about the design ascpect of the game. I chose blue tones and colors for my theme since it has been scientifically proven that the color blue helps with concentration and memory. Also, while the decision of making the choices of my game be given on the screen using processing was made due to the technical difficulties described above, I do think it makes the game more interesting in the sense that it might be harder for the user to recall the pattern once it’s written out as a pose to pressing the buttons that are right next to the LED’s that blinked (maybe something that has to do with visual memory)
