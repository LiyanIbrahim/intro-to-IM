## Adaptation of Memory Game using Arduino

For my Midterm project, I made a memory card game using processing. For this assignment, I wanted to adapt a similar concept to it but using LED’s in ardunio 

Initial Concept: 

For my initial concept, I wanted the LED’s to blink in a certain pattern then the user will try to recreate the pattern using the buttons. The processing would mainly be responsible for giving instructions that will be synchronized with the user input. I could not figure out a way in which the user can input after the LED’s light up. I’m still working on the code (which is also on this github repo) to figure this out.

Therefore, my adaptation of this assignment would utilize the fact that I’m using processing which reshow the user patterns which they have to pick the one that was just played by pressing on the corresponding button as shown in the video.
The game has 2 rounds, the second round will only start playing if the user guesses the first round correctly. Otherwise, if the user guesses wrong, the LED’s will light up all at once.
