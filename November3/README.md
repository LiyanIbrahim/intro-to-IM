For my puzzle, I decided to make a game in which the user guesses which light is blinking at the fastest rate. It has two stages: the first one being that the three LEDs blink at different rates but the on and off time are the same for each of the LED’s, the user has to click on the LED blinking at the fastest rate. The second stage, the user has to choose the LED that stays ON for the longest period of time and the LEDs have different on and off periods. </br> 
Instructions: 
<ol> 
  <li>When the program turns on, level 1 will start.</li> 

<li>Once the user has finished observing the lights, press the green button to stop them. </li>
<li>Then press on the button with the color corresponding to the LED that was blinking the fastest. </li>
<li>If correct, all LED’s light up and the user is moved to level 2. </li>
<li>If incorrect, the correct LED lights up and the user is moved to level 2. </li>
<li>Level 2 starts, user needs to press the green button to stop the lights after observing </li>
<li>Then press on the button with the color corresponding to the LED that was ON for the longest time. </li>
<li>If correct, all the LED’s light up. </li>
<li>If incorrect, the correct LED lights up. </li>
