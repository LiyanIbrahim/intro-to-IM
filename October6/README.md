# Data Visualization

## Concept 

For this assignment, I decided to visualize and display the concentration of greenhouse gases from 4 different sectors in 3 different regions in the world through an interactive system. 

## Instructions

Once you run the program, hover over the region you want and then hover over the circle with the desired sector to reveal the concentration of greenhouse gases produced by this sector in that region. 

## Data: 

I used [this](https://www.wri.org/blog/2020/02/greenhouse-gas-emissions-by-country-sector) link to get the information and produce my own datasheet that is saved as a csv. I did this because I could not find a ready csv with only the information I need. Since my program does not require much information, making my own csv was feasible and would help me debug since it did not contain any unnecessary data. </br>
