# Assignement 5
## Concept:

For this assignment, I was inspired by Daniel Shiffmansâ€™ [Painting with pixels](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NbX3RnlAyGU) idea of using the color of the pixel in the location to draw a certain shape. From that, I decided to implement that using different shapes. The idea then developed into using different images loaded into an array and using part of the image since I did not want to paint the image but rather use part of it and the color to develop an abstract illustration. I then added a level of user interaction using the mouse clicked function. 

## Process:

I first started out with around 20 images. Since I was picking the xy positions at random, I wanted images that are colorful enough so that they can produce good results most of the time. Therefore, I printed the image number that was producing the certain pattern and filtered the array by removing the images that produced the least interesting results. I also added the mouseClicked function to include some level of interactivity and reinforce the idea of  randomness in the method and colors.
