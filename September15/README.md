  For our first assignment, I did not anticipate how crucial the math aspect would be in drawing a self-portrait. I would constantly have to recalculate or intuitively guess the XY coordinates of the different parts. The main reason this happened was because I was not too familiar with the conventions attributed to each shape. For example, the x-coordinate in the ellipse represents the position of the center of the ellipse but the x-coordinate in a rectangle represents the position of the upper left corner of the rectangle. Therefore, using the reference page was extremely helpful and informative and allowed me to discover some extended features of some shapes. A notable example would be being able to make the edges of the rectangle rounder (more round?) by simply adding a value next to the height of the rectangle. It was also interesting to see how I was able to play around with the shapes by overlapping them (such as when covering the sides of the face with some “hair”). The most difficult part of this drawing was probably drawing the nose. I decided to use the curveVertex() function after googling “How to draw a curved line in processing” which suggested using this function “to make a continuous series of curves as part of a shape”. However, I did find using this function a little difficult to visualize.
