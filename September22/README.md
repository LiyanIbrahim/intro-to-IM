# September22 Assignment
<p>
  For this weekâ€™s production assignment, the most difficult part was coming up with a cool idea that was abstract and interactive. I started off with a simple idea and continued adding to the project from there keeping user experience and interactions in mind. 
This artwork allows the user to interact with it by hovering over the popup window and covering coloring it in with the line strokes until only the first pattern shows.

  This is the static interpretation of the artwork.
