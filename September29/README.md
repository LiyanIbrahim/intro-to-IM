# Assignment 3
## Object Oriented Artwork 
### Overall Concept:
<p>
  I wanted to create an artwork that, to some degree, represents the digital artwork generated on a screen when you leave it for too long. However, when I was researching different ideas, I came across the concept of Algorithmic Art (a genre of Generative art), which refers to art produced via an algorithm as described by Michael Tempel in [this](https://el.media.mit.edu/logo-foundation/services/pdf/genart.pdf) paper which heavily inspired me and shaped my thought process of the production of something inspired by generative art. I also wanted to try out an experiment with mathematical functions in the production of shapes. From all these different aspects, I produced a rather chaotic version of the computer screens. However, since it will continue looping indefinitely, it starts off as chaotic and random but as time passes, the pattern (that is essentially made out of points and ellipses) becomes more evident and structured. I also made most of the parameters of the constructors being passed as random numbers since I enjoyed the randomness that will be generated each time.
