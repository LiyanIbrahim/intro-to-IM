# Assignment 3
## Object Oriented Artwork 
### Overall Concept:
<p>
  I wanted to create an artwork that, to some degree, represents the digital artwork generated on a screen when you leave it for too long. However, when I was researching different ideas, I came across the concept of Algorithmic Art (a genre of Generative art), which refers to art produced via an algorithm as described by Michael Tempel in <a href = "https://el.media.mit.edu/logo-foundation/services/pdf/genart.pdf" target="_self">this </a> paper which heavily inspired me and shaped my thought process of the production of something inspired by generative art. I also wanted to try out an experiment with mathematical functions in the production of shapes. From all these different aspects, I produced a rather chaotic version of the computer screens. However, since it will continue looping indefinitely, it starts off as chaotic and random but as time passes, the pattern (that is essentially made out of points and ellipses) becomes more evident and structured. I also made most of the parameters of the constructors being passed as random numbers since I enjoyed the randomness that will be generated each time.

### General Static screenshots of artwork: (Looks cooler when the points are continuously

### Difficulties: 

<p>
  I didnâ€™t necessarily know what patterns I wanted the program to generate and so I had multiple failed attempts in which the program would not produce what I necessarily wanted and trying to figure out why and how to make it do what I want was challenging since I was also using mathematical formulas and visualizing those was somehow challenging with using for loops. Also, while I think my understanding of loops and arrays is good, once I included object oriented programming (and formed an array of objects), it was somewhat difficult to wrap my head around and debug. The use of OOP definitely made it easier for me to include a large number of overlapping patterns which is the main aspect of this artwork. 
</p>

### Other notes:

<p> I think the program is really cool when continuously running. When the second pattern runs, and continues running, the pattern resembles an abstract version of the bar chart. Also, even though my program produces all colors of the circles, it would be interesting to modify it to only allow certain colors which could potentially look cleaner.
