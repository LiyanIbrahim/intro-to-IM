## Week 1: 

### Day1:  

For my initial idea, I want to make an automated support system that uses processing and arduino and allows the user to portray their emotions and feelings without speaking. The program will use the different sensors to try to detect what the user is feeling and provide support based on that. I want this system to be really interactive and, to a certain extent, personalized towards what the user inputs and what the system is reading from the sensor. 

**Motivation:** 

We often think or assume that robots and machines are unbiased and easier to talk to due to the lack of human judgement. I wanted to play on that idea and make a system that offers support as a pose to someone you can speak to. 

Brainstorming: 

Here is a rough initial idea of somethings my robot could do:

### Day2: 

**Refined initial concept:**

While my initial concept was a support system, I think specifying it even more would make the product better and have features that are specific and explicit. Therefore, I decided to make it a study support system. Additionally, the design of the robot would be tailored towards this instead of being a very generally designed physical system.   

**Idea for implementation:** 

I want the body of this (or the arduino part) to be receptive to the surroundings and for the processing window to be the one the user controls. 

**Brainstorming the implementation:**

**My initial plan for implementing this:**

A cube structure:
One face for placing a drink. Detected by motion sensor. Has a temperature sensor to detect the temperature. Prompts the user to pick if it’s cold or iced. System will move on but display a reading on the edge if the drink gets too cold or too hot as the user does other things. 

One face for taking a break. Activated by pressing a button. Prompts users for 3 different things.1. A power nap → play relaxing music 2. Play a game → controls on arduino 3. Dance party → using servo motors and LED’s 

One face for holding different parts. Since I will be making this for myself. I would implement sockets for things I normally use. 

One face as the introduction for this entire game. Possibly using a button/mouse clicked to start the study system. 


After Identifying the different functionalities (which are prone to change), I need to create the graphics for each function and face for processing. But before doing that, I want to identify a color palette that I will use consistently in my project. 

**Color palette**

Color 1: 160, 154, 188</br>
Color 2: 182, 166, 202</br>
Color 3: 213, 207, 225</br>
Color 4: 225, 222, 233</br>
Color 5: 212, 190, 190</br>
