## Week 1: 

For my initial idea, I want to make an automated support system that uses processing and arduino and allows the user to portray their emotions and feelings without speaking. The program will use the different sensors to try to detect what the user is feeling and provide support based on that. I want this system to be really interactive and, to a certain extent, personalized towards what the user inputs and what the system is reading from the sensor. 

Motivation: 

We often think or assume that robots and machines are unbiased and easier to talk to due to the lack of human judgement. I wanted to play on that idea and make a system that offers support as a pose to someone you can speak to. 

Brainstorming: 

Here is a rough initial idea of somethings my robot could do:
