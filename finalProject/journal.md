## Week 1: 

For my initial idea, I want to make an automated support system that uses processing and arduino and allows the user to portray their emotions and feelings without speaking. The program will use the different sensors to try to detect what the user is feeling and provide support based on that. I want this system to be really interactive and, to a certain extent, personalized towards what the user inputs and what the system is reading from the sensor.
