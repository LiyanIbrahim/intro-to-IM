# Welcome to my Midterm Project! 

For my game, I decided to do a themed card game in which the user can pick between three themes, TV shows, bands and movies. 
I wanted the entire game to resemble 90’s arcade games and I did that using the music and even the fact that the cards do not shuffle making them a one time thing (unless you want to replay the same theme again.

## Reflections after finishing the assignment: 

Even though my code works exactly how I wanted it to. Here are some things about the code that I would change or do differently if I was to redo the assignment (by the time I realized, I was too far in). </br>
I should’ve approached the assignment slightly differently by creating more classes or more general classes. Many of my functionalities in this assignment could have been easily combined and put into a class. From that, these are the ideas I have (note that it might not be feasible to implement some of these ideas but if I realized this earlier, I would have tried it): </br>
<ol> 
  <li>A cards class that is dynamic enough to change the string of images used based on a certain variable. Even though I did have that, I had three classes for each theme but they could’ve easily been combined into one class. </li>
  <li> A deck or game class that deals with the functionalities that are present in the main code (not in the class). </li>
