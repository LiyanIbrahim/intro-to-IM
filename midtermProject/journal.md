## Concept: 

My initial idea is to make a themed memory card game in which the user has the choice to pick between three different themes and based on that theme, play the card game. Based on the theme, the cards, images, sounds are colors that will differ. Although this game can be implemented in multiple ways, I would like to adapt it so it is a single player game. </br>
The player will have a counter for the number of moves and the score. A perfect score in this game means that the number of moves =score.
